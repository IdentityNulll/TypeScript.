# Learning TypeScript

This repository is my personal playground for learning **TypeScript**.  

I’m exploring the basics of TypeScript, including:

- Writing and running TypeScript code
- Understanding types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.)
- Learning special types (`any`, `unknown`, `void`, `never`)
- Using union and intersection types
- Working with objects, arrays, tuples, and functions

> ⚠️ This project is purely for **learning purposes**, so expect experiments, small examples, and code snippets.

I am also excited to make a project in the end of the February (do not know what project i am gonna be making) but just know that :

- It is gonna be made using Typescript
- It is not gonna something like to-do list or something
- It may be some kinda related to animation (because i am interested in creating animated websites)

## How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Install TypeScript globally:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
